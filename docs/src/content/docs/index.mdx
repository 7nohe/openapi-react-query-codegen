import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';


<CardGrid>
	<Card title="React Query" icon="seti:react">
		Generates custom react hooks that use React(TanStack) Query's useQuery, useSuspenseQuery, useMutation and useInfiniteQuery hooks.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Prefetching & Router Integration" icon="vercel">
		Generates custom functions that use React Query's `ensureQueryData` and `prefetchQuery` functions to integrate into frameworks like Next.js and Remix.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Pure TypeScript Clients" icon="seti:typescript">
		Generates pure TypeScript clients generated by [@hey-api/openapi-ts](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts) in case you still want to do type-safe API calls without React Query.
	</Card>
